This is part of the final project of my first-semester class "Introduction to the career" carrying the purpose of encourage team work to develop a software product as happens in real life. The game has a lot of glitches due to the engine we were working on (made in Scratch) but the "code" or instructions behind it show the intended mechanics of every element of the game.
